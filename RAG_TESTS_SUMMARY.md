# RAG System Tests Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive test suite added for the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) functionality in the Rails chat application.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Model Tests

#### Document Model (`test/models/document_test.rb`)
- ✅ Basic validations (title, content, project presence)
- ✅ Embedding generation on content changes
- ✅ Graceful handling of embedding generation failures
- ✅ Conditional embedding regeneration (only when content changes)
- ✅ Project associations

#### Project Model (`test/models/project_test.rb`)
- ✅ Basic validations (name presence, user association)
- ✅ Has many chats and documents associations
- ✅ Dependent destroy behavior for associated records
- ✅ Optional instructions field
- ✅ User ownership

### 2. Service Tests

#### TextExtractionService (`test/services/text_extraction_service_test.rb`)
- ✅ Text extraction from plain text files (.txt)
- ✅ Text extraction from markdown files (.md)
- ✅ PDF text extraction (mocked)
- ✅ DOCX text extraction (mocked)
- ✅ Multiple PDF pages handling
- ✅ Unsupported file type error handling
- ✅ Case-insensitive file extensions
- ✅ Empty files handling
- ✅ Special characters in content

#### DocumentSearchService (`test/services/document_search_service_test.rb`)
- ✅ Vector similarity search functionality
- ✅ Project-specific document filtering
- ✅ Result limiting
- ✅ Content truncation for long documents
- ✅ Cosine distance usage
- ✅ Error handling for embedding failures
- ✅ Proper result formatting with separators
- ✅ Empty search results handling

### 3. Controller Tests

#### ProjectsController (`test/controllers/projects_controller_test.rb`)
- ✅ Index action (shows user's projects only)
- ✅ Show action with chats and documents
- ✅ New/Create actions with validation
- ✅ Edit/Update actions
- ✅ Destroy action with dependent records
- ✅ Authentication requirements
- ✅ AJAX support for instructions updates
- ✅ Empty state handling
- ✅ Project statistics display

#### DocumentsController (`test/controllers/documents_controller_test.rb`)
- ✅ Index action (project-specific documents)
- ✅ Show action
- ✅ File upload functionality (HTML and AJAX)
- ✅ Error handling for file processing
- ✅ Multiple file type support
- ✅ Temporary file cleanup
- ✅ Security (user can't access other projects)
- ✅ Authentication requirements

### 4. Job Tests

#### ChatStreamJob (`test/jobs/chat_stream_job_test.rb`)
- ✅ RAG prompt enhancement with project instructions
- ✅ RAG prompt enhancement with relevant documents
- ✅ Handling of projects without instructions
- ✅ Handling when no relevant documents found
- ✅ No enhancement for chats without projects
- ✅ Correct DocumentSearchService parameter passing
- ✅ Error handling and graceful degradation
- ✅ Streaming response handling (mocked)

### 5. System Tests

#### Projects Workflow (`test/system/projects_workflow_test.rb`)
- ✅ End-to-end project creation
- ✅ Document upload workflow
- ✅ Chat creation within projects
- ✅ Navigation between projects and chats
- ✅ Empty state displays
- ✅ Instructions editing in sidebar
- ✅ Security (other users' projects inaccessible)
- ✅ Responsive design elements

## Test Fixtures

Created additional test fixtures to support the new functionality:
- `test/fixtures/sessions.yml` - Session fixtures for authentication
- `test/fixtures/projects.yml` - Project test data (auto-generated)

## Key Testing Strategies

### 1. Mocking External Dependencies
- **RubyLLM.embed**: Mocked for embedding generation tests
- **PDF::Reader**: Mocked for PDF text extraction
- **Docx::Document**: Mocked for DOCX text extraction
- **DocumentSearchService**: Mocked for RAG integration tests

### 2. Security Testing
- User isolation (users can't access other users' projects/documents)
- Authentication requirements for all endpoints
- Project ownership verification

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when embedding generation fails
- File processing error handling
- API error handling in RAG workflows

### 4. Integration Testing
- Full RAG workflow from user question to enhanced prompt
- File upload to document processing pipeline
- Project creation to chat interaction workflow

## Test Commands

```bash
# Run all RAG-related tests
rails test test/models/document_test.rb
rails test test/models/project_test.rb
rails test test/services/
rails test test/controllers/projects_controller_test.rb
rails test test/controllers/documents_controller_test.rb
rails test test/jobs/chat_stream_job_test.rb

# Run system tests
rails test:system test/system/projects_workflow_test.rb

# Run specific test
rails test test/models/document_test.rb -n test_should_generate_embedding_when_content_changes
```

## Benefits

1. **Regression Prevention**: Tests ensure RAG functionality continues working as expected
2. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of the RAG system behavior
3. **Confidence**: Comprehensive coverage gives confidence when making changes
4. **CI/CD Ready**: Tests can be integrated into continuous integration pipelines

## Future Enhancements

- Add performance tests for large document sets
- Add tests for document chunking (if implemented)
- Add integration tests with real embedding models (in staging environment)
- Add tests for concurrent document processing
